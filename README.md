# The Containers

The Containers is a lightweight homelab dashboard, reverse proxy controller, and self-host deployment manager. It gives users one place to register existing services, deploy Docker-based apps and local binary services, assign ports, bind routes, check health, and keep Caddy reverse proxy configuration in sync.

The project is designed for mini PCs, NAS boxes, Raspberry Pi hosts, home servers, and small cloud machines. It treats services as plain HTTP upstreams, so Docker, Docker Compose, bare-metal processes, NAS apps, and LAN devices can all appear in the same dashboard.

## Current Status

Available now:

- App dashboard with categories, tags, favorites, ordering, and health status.
- Admin panel for app CRUD, import/export, backup/restore, settings, audits, diagnostics, and proxy sync.
- Caddy Admin API integration for generated reverse proxy configuration.
- Subdomain and subpath routing modes. Subdomain mode is recommended.
- Local service discovery for ports already listening on the host running The Containers.
- DNS diagnostics for route and public domain checks.
- Docker run deployments with command parsing, automatic port assignment, permission checks, and managed cleanup.
- Docker Compose deployments with YAML parsing, web service selection, port inference, bind mount checks, host network handling, and managed cleanup.
- Binary/service deployments for local HTTP services, installed as user systemd services on Linux or launchd agents on macOS.
- Host permission panel for Docker CLI, Docker daemon, Compose runtime, bind mounts, privileged containers, capabilities, devices, host networking, Docker socket mounts, public domain DNS, and Caddy sync.
- Managed deployment records. Apps deployed by The Containers are marked as managed and are cleaned up when deleted.
- Managed deployment controls for start, stop, restart, logs, image pull, redeploy, and redeploy safety preview.
- Deployment drift checks for missing containers, stopped containers, missing Compose files, port mismatches, and missing redeploy metadata.
- Drift repair actions for starting stopped deployments, redeploying missing resources, and updating app targets from runtime ports.
- Backup and restore for apps, settings, managed deployment records, and redeploy metadata.

Planned:

- GitHub auto-detect deployments.
- Static site deployments.
- Node.js app deployments.
- Python app deployments.
- Advanced custom command deployments.
- Multi-host or agent-based management.

## Stack

- Web: React, Vite, TailwindCSS
- API: Node.js, Fastify
- Database: SQLite
- Reverse proxy: Caddy Admin API
- Deploy runtime: Docker CLI, Docker Compose, user systemd, and launchd

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Default development URLs:

- Web: `http://localhost:5173`
- API: `http://localhost:3001`

## Production Build

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm start
```

The production API serves both `/api/*` and the built web dashboard.

## Linux Deployment

See [docs/deploy-linux.md](docs/deploy-linux.md) for the Debian/Ubuntu mini PC deployment path using Node.js, SQLite, Caddy, and systemd.

Fast path after cloning the repository:

```bash
./install.sh
./start.sh
```

For a new Linux server where you want Docker permissions repaired and The Containers started automatically on boot, run:

```bash
./deploy/setup-autostart.sh
```

The autostart script installs missing Debian/Ubuntu packages when `apt-get` is available, adds the service user to the `docker` group, detects rootless Docker sockets when present, writes `/etc/the-containers/the-containers.env`, builds the app, installs the Caddyfile, and creates `the-containers.service`.

If you want the service to run as a specific user:

```bash
THE_CONTAINERS_SERVICE_USER=alexander ./deploy/setup-autostart.sh
```

## Environment

Common production variables:

```env
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=3001
ADMIN_TOKEN=
DASHBOARD_AUTH_REQUIRED=false
CORS_ORIGIN=
DATABASE_PATH=/opt/the-containers/data/the-containers.sqlite
WEB_DIST_PATH=/opt/the-containers/apps/web/dist
CADDY_ADMIN_URL=http://127.0.0.1:2019
CADDY_SYNC_ENABLED=true
CADDY_LISTEN=:80
DOCKER_BIN=docker
DEPLOYMENTS_PATH=/opt/the-containers/data/deployments
HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS=0
THE_CONTAINERS_DASHBOARD_TARGET_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3001
```

For production, set a strong `ADMIN_TOKEN`. Set `DASHBOARD_AUTH_REQUIRED=true` if the read-only dashboard should also require authentication.

## Deployments

The Containers can deploy from:

- `docker run` commands
- Docker Compose YAML
- Binary/service commands for local HTTP services

The deploy flow is:

1. Paste a Docker command, Compose file, or Binary/service command.
2. The Containers auto-fills app name, route host, and ports when possible.
3. Review Host permission checks.
4. Preview the deployment plan.
5. Deploy.
6. The Containers creates the app route and saves a managed deployment record.

Binary/service deployments require the local web port where the service listens. The Containers does not auto-remap Binary/service ports because the user-provided command controls the listener. On Linux, Binary/service deployments are installed as user systemd services. On macOS, they are installed as launchd agents.

When a managed app is deleted, The Containers attempts to remove the related Docker container, Compose project, or local service and free the route.

## Managed Deployment Operations

Apps deployed by The Containers receive a `Self-Host` badge and a managed deployment record. From the Admin app details view, managed apps can be:

- Started, stopped, and restarted.
- Inspected with runtime status, Compose container details, or local service status.
- Viewed through recent Docker, Docker Compose, journalctl, or launchd logs.
- Updated with image pull.
- Redeployed from saved deployment metadata.
- Checked for deployment drift.
- Repaired when a safe repair action is available.

Redeploy preview shows what will be pulled, recreated, preserved, and removed before the action runs. Docker run redeploy requires saved metadata, so older deployments may need to be deleted and deployed again once before safe redeploy is available.

Deployment drift checks can detect:

- Missing Docker containers or Compose project containers.
- Stopped managed deployments.
- Missing managed Compose files.
- Stopped managed local services.
- App target ports that no longer match saved deployment metadata or runtime ports.
- Docker run deployments that are missing redeploy metadata.

Backup exports include apps, settings, managed deployment records, redeploy metadata, managed deployment files, discovered Docker Compose project files, and readable Docker bind mount or named volume data. By default, the backup scans all local Docker containers so Dockge-managed stacks and manually started containers can be included in the same bundle. Set `BACKUP_DOCKER_SCOPE=managed` to only include deployments created by The Containers. See [docs/migration-checklist.md](docs/migration-checklist.md) before moving The Containers to a new host.

## Important Safety Model

The Containers automates common deployment work, but it does not bypass operating system permissions.

It can automatically:

- Allocate safe high ports.
- Create normal writable bind mount paths.
- Write managed Compose files.
- Write managed user systemd services or launchd agents for Binary/service deployments.
- Call Docker and Docker Compose.
- Sync Caddy routes.
- Remove managed containers, Compose projects, or local service files.
- Start, stop, restart, pull, and redeploy managed deployments.
- Export and restore managed deployment metadata.

It will not silently:

- Run `sudo`.
- Install root-level system services.
- Change Docker socket permissions.
- Modify router port forwarding.
- Change public DNS records.
- Expose Caddy Admin API to the public internet.
- Override protected host paths without user action.
- Guarantee that every app data file exists on a new host after restore. The backup restores readable Docker data and uses named Docker volumes when possible, but unreadable host paths, skipped large files, external databases, DNS records, and router rules may still require separate backup.

Host permission checks are shown before deploy so users can see what is ready, what The Containers can handle, and what needs manual host authorization.

## Validation
